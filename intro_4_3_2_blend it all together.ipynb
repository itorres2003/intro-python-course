The possible positions are: <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">'GK'</span> (goalkeeper), <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">'M'</span> (midfield), <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">'A'</span> (attack) and <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">'D'</span> (defense). The second list, <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">heights</span>, contains integers representing the height of the player in cm.
