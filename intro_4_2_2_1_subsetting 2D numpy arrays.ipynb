    "If your 2D <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">numpy</span> array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">\"a\"</span> and <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">\"c\"</span> are extracted from a list of lists.\n",

    "For regular Python lists, this is a real pain. For 2D <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">numpy</span> arrays, however, it's pretty intuitive! The indexes before the comma refer to the rows, while those after the comma refer to the columns. The <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">:</span> is for slicing; in this example, it tells Python to include all rows.\n",

    "The code that converts the pre-loaded <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">baseball</span> list to a 2D <span style=\"background-color: #CFDCE2\">numpy</span> array is already in the script. The first column contains the players' height in inches and the second column holds player weight, in pounds. Add some lines to make the correct selections. Remember that in Python, the first element is at index 0!\n",
